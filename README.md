Goal of the project is to practice implementing different types of methods of
basic neural net algorithms such as regression, ANN, CNN, etc. Or for 
methods of optimization, such as dropout, regularization, etc.

MNIST data is imported using tensorflow tutorials.

Skeleton of code bases itself on other tutorials such as tensorflows,
or video lectures from youtube.
